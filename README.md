**Ascended Rotation Solver Reborn — personal fork of RSR**

![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn.svg?label=License&style=for-the-badge)

This is a personal fork of [FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn). It tracks upstream and layers one experimental feature on top: a scoring-based PvP hostile target selector (`PvPSmart`). PvE behavior is identical to upstream.

If you don't specifically want the `PvPSmart` targeting mode, install upstream RSR instead. This fork does not publish its own Dalamud plugin repository; it exists primarily as a development branch for the PvP targeting work.

## What this fork adds

A new `TargetingType.PvPSmart` mode that replaces the role-blind `Auto(LowHP)` cycle in PvP with a scoring-based selector. For each candidate hostile, the scorer composes a weighted scalar over pure factors and picks the argmax:

- **Invuln short-circuit** — Guard, Hallowed Ground, Living Dead, Holmgang, Superbolide are skipped outright
- **Role value** — Healer / Ranged DPS weighted above Melee / Tank
- **Effective HP & finish** — current HP scaled by active mitigation statuses, with a finish-kill bias when a candidate is within burst range
- **Mitigation penalty** — heavy DR cooldowns deprioritize a target during the window they're active
- **Distance penalty** — soft falloff as targets approach the effective range edge
- **Hysteresis** — small sticky bonus for the previous target to prevent GCD-to-GCD oscillation between near-equal candidates
- **Crystal carrier awareness** *(Crystalline Conflict)* — the hostile holding the crystal gains a bonus
- **LB cast awareness** — hostiles mid-cast on a Limit Break gain a bonus (interrupt priority)
- **Isolation factor** — sigmoid bonus the further a hostile is from its nearest ally (catches stragglers)
- **Threat factor** — bonus when a hostile is targeting a low-HP ally or a party healer (peel priority)
- **Burst conservation** — high-impact PvP burst actions are held through unclear windows and spent on valuable, vulnerable, or kill-secure targets

Two preset weight profiles (Casual, Ranked) are bundled, plus a Custom preset for hand-tuned weights. A toggleable debug overlay renders the full per-target score breakdown in real time for tuning.

The existing `PvPHealers` / `PvPDPS` / `PvPTanks` modes remain as explicit role overrides.

### Testing burst conservation

Burst conservation is experimental. The current fail-safe behavior has only been tested on Bard so far. Other PvP jobs still use the shared gate, but their job-specific burst timing needs separate in-game validation.

Burst conservation is enabled by default after installing this fork. To toggle it, open RSR settings and go to `Duty` > `PvP`, then use:

```
Conserve burst in PvP unless the target is valuable, vulnerable, or killable.
```

For the intended Ranked Crystalline Conflict behavior, also make sure `Target` > `Hostile` has `PvPSmart` in the PvP hostile targeting list, preferably first.

For Bard specifically, `Pitch Perfect`, `Apex Arrow`, and `Powerful Shot` continue to keep the job cycling. `Harmonic Arrow`, `Blast Arrow`, and `Encore of Light` still honor the gate, but spend if a charge cap or ready timer would otherwise be wasted.

This setting may lower raw total damage because it avoids spending burst into Guard, heavy mitigation, tanks, or low-value targets that are unlikely to die. The goal is higher kill conversion, better secure-kill timing, and fewer wasted burst windows rather than higher scoreboard damage. When testing, compare kill participation, burst held for healer or ranged DPS windows, and missed opportunities where the gate felt too conservative.

### Status & caveats

- Starting weights are conservative seeds. Empirical tuning across Ranked CC matches is pending.
- Crystal-carrier `StatusID` and the `PvPLBs.json` database are stubs awaiting in-game observation; the carrier and LB factors evaluate to zero until those are populated.

## Upstream features

Everything below is inherited unchanged from upstream RSR:

- **Dynamic Rotation Guidance (Training Mode)** — real-time rotation suggestions tailored to the in-game situation
- **Customizable Settings** — adjust rotations per preference, encounter, and boss mechanics
- **Comprehensive Database** — extensive class ability coverage for accurate rotation
- **User-Friendly Interface** — clean ImGui surface
- **Regular Updates** — upstream tracks game patches and class changes; this fork periodically pulls from it

## Installing

This plugin is distributed through the [ascended-plugins](https://github.com/jkleinne/ascended-plugins) Dalamud repository, which aggregates all `ascended-*` plugin forks under a single URL. Add it to Dalamud once and any future plugin in that namespace becomes available without extra repository entries.

- Open `/xlsettings` in chat and switch to the Experimental tab
- Scroll past DevPlugins to the Custom Plugin Repositories section
- Paste this URL into a free text input:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkleinne/ascended-plugins/main/pluginmaster.json
```

- Click `+`, tick the new entry's checkbox, and save
- Reopen Dalamud's plugin installer; "Ascended Rotation Solver Reborn" appears under Available Plugins

**Coexistence with upstream RSR:** this fork uses a distinct `InternalName`, so Dalamud loads it as a separate plugin. It does, however, register the same `/rotation` and `/rsr` chat commands as upstream, so the two cannot run simultaneously without command-registration conflicts. Uninstall upstream RSR before installing this fork.

If you'd rather use the official upstream binary distribution:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/CombatRebornRepo/main/pluginmaster.json
```

## Contributing

PvP targeting work goes here. Anything else should be contributed upstream:

- For PvP scoring changes (factors, weights, debug overlay): fork this repo, branch from `main`, open a PR against `jkleinne/ascended-rotationsolverreborn:main`
- For everything else (rotations, PvE behavior, core engine): contribute to [upstream RSR](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn) instead — changes there flow into this fork on the next sync

Combat rotation changes should be validated against [Stone, Sky, Sea](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Stone,_Sky,_Sea) per expansion before submission.
